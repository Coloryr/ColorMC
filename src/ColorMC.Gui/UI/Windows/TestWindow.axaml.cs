Thanks to countless hours of research, it often outperforms other optimization solutions in benchmarks, and when it doesn't, I investigate why to improve it further.\n\nSO is explicitly built with simplicity and high maintainability in mind; the goal is to make for a reflection of the bleeding edge of Minecraft optimization at the time, and that's what the focus is on. That means little to <u>no quality-of-life or visual enhancements are included</u> in the pack by default - you are expected to add any non-optimization mods you want on your own.   \n\nThis also means it's able to recieve mod updates with new performance improvements quickly, and update to new Minecraft versions in a matter of hours! I strive to keep the pack as relevant as it can be at any given moment.\n\nIf you're having issues with the modpack, even if only after adding extra mods to it, feel free to ask for support in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WSQdQZUjeR) and we'll try to help out!
