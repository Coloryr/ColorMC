Thanks to countless hours of research, it often outperforms other optimization solutions in benchmarks, and when it doesn't, I investigate why to improve it further.\n\nSO is explicitly built with simplicity and high maintainability in mind; the goal is to make for a reflection of the bleeding edge of Minecraft optimization at the time, and that's what the focus is on. That means little to <u>no quality-of-life or visual enhancements are included</u> in the pack by default - you are expected to add any non-optimization mods you want on your own.   \n\nThis also means it's able to recieve mod updates with new performance improvements quickly, and update to new Minecraft versions in a matter of hours! I strive to keep the pack as relevant as it can be at any given moment.\n\nIf you're having issues with the modpack, even if only after adding extra mods to it, feel free to ask for support in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WSQdQZUjeR) and we'll try to help out! Also join if you have any feedback you want to share - all is welcome.\n\n<sub>I can't be bothered to maintain a mod list on this page anymore - Modrinth will list the mods used in each version on its page anyway, so refer to that.</sub>\n<!--\n<details><summary>Included mods (1?)</summary>\n\n- [BadOptimizations](https://modrinth.com/mod/badoptimizations) by [thosea](https://modrinth.com/user/thosea) (Low-impact miscellaneous optimizations)\n- [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) by [shedaniel](https://modrinth.com/user/shedaniel) (dependency for MoreCulling)\n- [C2ME](https://modrinth.com/mod/c2me-fabric) by [ishland](https://modrinth.com/user/ishland) (Multithreading optimizations to chunk loading, generation and saving)  \n- [Enhanced Block Entities](https://modrinth.com/mod/ebe) by [FoundationGames](https://modrinth.com/user/FoundationGames) (Reimplements block (tile) entities for performance)  \n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling) by [tr7zw](https://modrinth.com/user/tr7zw) (Uses path tracing to cull entities behind walls)  \n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (Needed for many mods to function)  \n- [FerriteCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core) by [malte0811](https://modrinth.com/user/malte0811) (Memory usage optimizations)  \n- [ImmediatelyFast](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast) by [RaphiMC](https://modrinth.com/user/RaphiMC) (Immediate-mode rendering optimizations concerning many areas of the game)   \n- [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) by the [caffeinemc team](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric) (Well-known - general server-side optimizations)  \n- [ModernFix](https://modrinth.com/mod/modernfix) by [embeddedt](https://modrinth.com/user/embeddedt) (A miscellaneous optimization mod targeting load times and memory usage)\n- [MoreCulling](https://modrinth.com/mod/moreculling) by [FX]([https://modrinth.com/user/FX](https://modrinth.com/user/FX)) (various culling-related optimizations)\n- [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) by [Aizistral](https://modrinth.com/user/Aizistral) (A mod that provides options to protect yourself against the chat reporting system introduced in 1.19.1.
