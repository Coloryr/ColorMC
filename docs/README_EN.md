## Supported Platforms
- Linux (providing deb, pkg, rpm)
- Windows
- macOS

**Note: ARM64 platform compatibility is not guaranteed.  
Due to the complexity of Linux distributions, compatibility varies between devices. If it doesnâ€™t work, you may need to troubleshoot it yourself. I have only tested the launcher in my own virtual machine. Driver compatibility issues are not within my scope of support.**

## Installation
